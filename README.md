# Hermes

Carpooling Discord bot made for the AFUP events.

## Getting Started

You will require:
- `castor` (see [these instructions](https://github.com/jolicode/castor?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for how to install)
- a `.env.local` file in `app/` folder with:
    - your Discord bot token (see [related documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#configuring-your-bot) for how to make and recover a bot token)
    - your Discord user id (how to [get your Discord client id](https://www.alphr.com/discord-find-user-id/))

```shell
app/bin/console hermes:register
app/bin/console hermes:event # will create the event you need

### Database

You'll need to run a local Postgres database.
I recommend using Docker for this: `docker run -e POSTGRES_USER=afup -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=p4ssw0rd --network host postgres:16.2`
